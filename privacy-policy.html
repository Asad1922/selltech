                        <li><strong>To Provide and Manage Our Services:</strong> We use your information to deliver our software development, digital marketing, and other services as requested by you. This includes managing your projects, providing customer support, and processing payments.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf. These may include hosting providers, payment processors, analytics companies, and marketing partners. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</li>
                        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that SellTech is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract.</li>
                        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We take the security of your data very seriously. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. These measures include the use of encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to take steps to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.</p>

                    <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
